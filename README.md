this is still very much a work in progress.  the calculations for the stacking of all items shown should be working as intended though.  

to do:

- a few individual items still need some tweaking for item limitation (ie predatory instincts).  

- add the rest of the items in game.

- get scroll to work on individual containers.

- display item effects in a more meaningful way.

- make layout more beautiful.

- add mobile functionality.

- add individual characters and character abilites?

- add a list of all chosen effects for build?
